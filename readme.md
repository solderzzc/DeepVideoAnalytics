Deep Video Analytics is a platform for indexing and extracting information from videos and images.
With latest version of docker installed correctly, you can run Deep Video Analytics in minutes
locally (even without a GPU) using a single command.

#### For installation instructions & demo please visit [https://www.deepvideoanalytics.com](https://www.deepvideoanalytics.com)

### Documentation & tutorial

- For a quick overview we **strongly recommend** going through the [presentation in readme.pdf](/docs/readme.pdf)

- Documentation along with a tutorial is being written in [/docs/tutorial](/docs/tutorial) directory.

### Experiments

- **OCR example has been moved to [/docs/experiments/ocr](/docs/experiments/ocr) directory**.
- More experiments coming soon!


### Deployment

We provide instructions for deploying DVA in three scenarios.

1. [deploy/cpu](/deploy/cpu) contains docker-compose files for non-GPU single machine deployments on Linode, AWS, GCP etc.

2. [deploy/gpu](/deploy/gpu) contains docker-compose files for GPU single machine deployments on GCP, AWS etc.

3. [deploy/kube](/deploy/kube) contains files used for launching DVA in a scalable GKE + GCS setup


### Development

- [deploy/dev](/deploy/dev) contains docker-compose files for interactively developing DVA by using  host server directory mapped as a volume.


### Code organization

- /client : Python client using DVA REST API
- /configs : ngnix config + defaults.py defining models + processing pipelines (can be replaced by mounting a volume)
- /deploy : Dockerfiles + Instructions for development, single machine deployment and scalable deployment with Kubernetes
- /docs : Documentation, tutorial and experiments
- /tests : Files required for testing
- /repos : Code copied from third party repos, e.g. Yahoo LOPQ, TF-CTPN etc.
- /server : dvalib + django server contains contains bulk of the code for UI, App and models.
- /logs : Empty dir for storing logs
